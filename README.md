Minecraft-Turn-Based-Battle-Mod
===============================

A mod for Minecraft (using Minecraft Forge) that employs a turn-based battle system.


Mod currently compiles on Minecraft Forge 1.6.2-9.10.0.789


To use, check out the Downloads page on the wiki to get the latest compiled version of the mod as well as instructions.
Alternatively, setup Minecraft Forge 1.6.2-9.10.0.789 and place the "burnedkirby" folder in src for compiling.


Notice: The mod will create a directory in the .minecraft folder. There you can find configs and a directory to place custom battle music in.

Other notes:

You cannot enter battle while in Creative mode.

You can change what mobs will enter battle by editing the XML settings file in the folder created by the mod.

You can change the rates of things in battle such as evasion rate in the XML settings file as well.

You can add music to the music folder but they must be ogg's or wav's.


There exists a minecraftforum.net thread at http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1894841-turn-based-minecraft/ but I will be checking GitHub more often than the thread.

It is best to contact me via burnedkirby@gmail.com (for now).
