Minecraft-Turn-Based-Battle-Mod
===============================

A mod for Minecraft (using Minecraft Forge) that employs a turn-based battle system.

This mod is still in development, as in it is not finished.


Mod currently compiles on Minecraft Forge 1.5.2-7.8.1.738

Development for Minecraft version 1.6.2 will begin when the release version of Minecraft Forge for that version is released.


To use, check out the Downloads page on the wiki to get the latest compiled version of the mod as well as instructions.
Alternatively, setup Minecraft Forge 1.5.2-7.8.1.738 and place the "burnedkirby" folder in src for compiling.



It is best to contact me via burnedkirby@gmail.com (for now).
